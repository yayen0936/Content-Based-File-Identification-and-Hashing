# Content-Based-File-Identification-and-Hashing
This Python triage script inspects file content rather than filenames or extensions by validating magic bytes and header structures to determine the true file type. It generates cryptographic hashes per file to support integrity and correlation during malware analysis, ensuring artifacts are correctly identified and prioritized for investigation.
